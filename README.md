# 🌿 **PlantPal: Smart Plant Pot**

**PlantPal** is an innovative, smart plant pot that brings your plant to life by displaying emotions based on its needs. Using data from moisture, temperature, and light sensors, **PlantPal** provides feedback on your plant's health, making it feel more like a pet. By showing emotions like **"Thirsty"** or **"Happy,"** it fosters an interactive and caring relationship between you and your plant.

This project is designed to be simple and straightforward, creating a professional yet accessible way to enhance plant care using technology.

### **Features**

**PlantPal** displays six different emotions based on sensor data:

1. **Thirsty**  
   *Emotion*: 💧 (Thirsty Emoji)  
   *Description*: The plant needs water.

### **How It Works**

1. **Set Up the Sensors**  
   - Connect the **LM35 temperature sensor**, **LDR light sensor**, and **capacitive soil moisture sensor** to your **PlantPal** pot.

2. **Install the Necessary Software**  
   - Install the required **MicroPython** libraries for sensor readings.

3. **Connect the Display**  
   - Hook up the **1.8-inch display** to show the emotions of the plant.

4. **Copy the Code to Raspberry Pi Pico**  
   - Open **Thonny** and flash your **Raspberry Pi Pico** with **MicroPython**.
   - Copy the code files from your project folder to the Pico individually (e.g., copy two code files from the `lib` folder to the Pico).
   - **Note**: Avoid copying the entire folder to the Pico; instead, copy only the necessary files.

5. **Power Up and Monitor**  
   - Once powered on, the **PlantPal** will start monitoring the plant’s conditions and display its emotions accordingly.
